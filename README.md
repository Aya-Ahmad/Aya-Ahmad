# ðŸ§  Functionista

**`Logic Lady (The Aspiring Algorithmist )`**

As a beginner developer, I see coding as more than just a skill â€” it's my gateway to creativity. Iâ€™m on an exciting journey to explore the world of technology and inspire others along the way. You know what's great about being a developer? When you find something you don't like, you can just build a better version of it! One of the things I enjoy most about programming is the constant learning and growth. There is always something new to discover, explore, and master ðŸ“ˆ. 
Iâ€™m curious to meet talented, humble, and fun people who are a bit crazy about coding, tech, and lifelong learning!
